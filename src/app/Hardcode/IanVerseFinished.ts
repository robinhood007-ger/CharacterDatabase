On the day he wanted to confess to her however, she disappeared and with some inner feeling driving him, he had the feeling she was kidnapped for sure. And as he would find out that indeed was right. In the wild chase of getting her out of there, Ian would have accidentally looked into a cursed mirror the gang wanted to sell. After they barely escaped out of there and he finally confessed to her. Something however was off as he felt like his brain was vanishing more and more by the exact moment. And just like that the girl was shot from across the street, killed almost instantly. And with Ian's memory disappeared almost completely by now, his earliest memory indeed is this sight.
               And so without any knowledge except for his name and age and some basic other things, he broke of his college studies, teared bonds with what once was his family and ultimately open up his new passion: A Blacksmith Store.
